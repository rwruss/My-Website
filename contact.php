If you like what you see here or are interested in what I can do with webGL and other technologies, I am available for contract or hire.  I am in the 
Austin, TX area and will work remotely or in the area depending on the opportunity.  I am also available for and interested in helping 
with any public sites that may have a question or need.  I look forward to talking with you about your project - Please <a href='mailto:rwruss@rwruss.com'>Email Me</a>
